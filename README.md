# Automatic Pet Feeder
For Electro Jam 2024, the purpose of this project is to develop skills and gain a better understanding of electrical systems with a focus on the theme being cats and dogs. I will be designing an automatic pet feeder and demonstrating the functionality and feasibility of this system. The feeder will help owners simplify their daily routines by providing a convenient and reliable solution to feed their dog/cat on schedule.
